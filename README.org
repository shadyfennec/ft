#+Title: ft: yes, another terminal emulator

*ft* is a very, /very/ early prototype for a terminal emulator. If I don't
abandon this project in the next 2 weeks, I hope to implement both
ligatures (using the harbuzz engine) and true color support.

* Compile
To compile, run =make=.

* Install (why would you do that ?!)
To install, run =make install=. You may need to have elevated
privileges. You can customize the installation directory with make's
=DESTDIR= variable and by modifying the directories in config.mk.
